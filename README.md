# Netflix-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
Built an incremental data processing pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Delta Live Tables for real-time transformations and analytics. Data flows from GitHub to Databricks via AutoLoader, stored in Data Lake Gen2, transformed into a Star Schema, and served in Azure Synapse for Power BI reporting.
